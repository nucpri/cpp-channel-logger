Add tests to verify that:
- CLog.hpp & CLog-minified.hpp provide the same output

# cpp-channel-logger
CLog is a well-documented single-file header-only library that aims to provide powerful &amp; readable single-line logging. NOTE: well-documented isn't true at this point of time :)

There are two versions:  
```CLog.hpp``` which prioritizes human-readable implementations.  
```CLog-minified.hpp``` which aims to be as tiny as possible, thus sacrificing readability.

Only tagged releases are suitable for use in production.

Note: comparing them side-by-side might be a great way to learn!
